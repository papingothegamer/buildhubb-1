# buildhubb-1
This is my first task with BuildHubb.
I took inspiration from the FX television series "The Bear", because it reminds me a lot about kitchen work and the stress that comes with demanding perfection in most situations in life.
A majority of this project was laid out in my head, and I used HTML, CSS and JS to handle styling, responsiveness and features of each part of the site. 
Also, I spent 3 hours doing this. I wan go sleep.
Deploy link will be added when i'm up.
